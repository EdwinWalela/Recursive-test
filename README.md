## Performance test using Fibonacci (Recursively) 

A terminal application written in C++ which calculates fibonnacci of any integer

run `app.exe` on  your terminal

Integer vs Computational Time (seconds)
  - 10  -------    0
  - 20  -------    0
  - 30  -------    0
  - 40  -------    1
  - 50  -------   177
  - 60  -------   N/A
  
  
  
  
  What is your computational time for **'60'**??
